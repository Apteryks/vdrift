Textures
--------

Textures are all in [Portable Network Graphic (PNG)](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/) format. Graphics can be 24 or 32 bit color, but if you don't need the Alpha channel leave it out. We prefer to produce these graphics using [The GIMP](http://gimp.org/), and many of the originals in the [Art repository](Art_repository.md) are in GIMP's native format (XCF). Other originals are created in [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) using its native [Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/) format.

Models
------

Models used in the game are all [JOE format](JOE_format.md), which is produced by a Python script for [Blender3D](http://www.blender3d.org/). Currently models are used for cars (glass, interiors, wheels, etc.) and track objects. Get the modeling tools from the **tools** directory of the [Art repository](Art_repository.md). There are two [JOE export scripts](JOE_export_scripts.md), **export-joe-0.3.py** and **export-all-joe-0.3.py**.

Sounds
------

Sounds are in PCM Waveform (WAV) format which can be editing using any waveform audio editor such as [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/).
